## Installing LaTeX
### Windows
https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html

### MacOs
- Only basics (may not have everything pre-installed): https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html
- Everything (is a huge download): https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html

## Running stuff
### Compile your own stuff (only works on own branch)
- Windows (in cmd): build.bat
- MacOs (terminal): ./build.sh

### Continuously rebuild
- Windows (in cmd): watch.bat
- MacOs (terminal): ./watch.sh

### Compile entire project
- Windows (in cmd): build-all.bat
- MacOs (terminal): ./build-all.sh

## Recommendations
### Split screen
Use a split screen setup with a text editor on one side and the output pdf on the other and then run the continuously rebuild commands so you can see what the final pdf looks like while typing.
